#Maji


Maji is an app that serves the dual purpose of a water source locator and group-funding mechanism, allowing the needs of both types of clients to be met.

Those in need of water can find the nearest local source, based on geolocation and utilization of the Google Maps API. Others who would like to contribute to funding various humaitarian projects can contribute monetarily with use of the PayPal API and can monitor how their contributions have attributed to projects thus far.

Maji uses Rails '2.3.3'

Front-end code for Maji can be found at: https://github.com/kells08/Maji-front-end
